	<h1>About me</h1>
  <hr>
	<p>I am an analytical thinker and enjoy thinking creatively to solve quantitative challenges. 
  Because of this I’m majoring in economics with a math emphasis and intend to also double major in data science. 
  Currently a rising junior at UW Madison, I plan to pursue a career where I can contribute data-driven solutions to business decision-making. 
  I’m presently cementing my skillset self-studying programming languages like python, 
  R...and honing those skills with hands-on opportunities to apply what I have learned. 
  I also take great interest in exploring research opportunities in fields needing the application of data science. “Learning by doing”, is my motto!

  Being involved in a community is important to me and I have been involved in a wide range of activities at UW-Madison 
  from being a student org board member to being a psychological support volunteer. 
  I am excited to continue to grow by contributing my skills to your organization.</p>
